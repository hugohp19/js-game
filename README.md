### Lenguage: javascript
### Enviroment: Nodejs / console

* Game play
The program thinks of a word; the user tries to guess what it is one letter at a time. The program draws a number of dashes equivalent to the number of letters in the word. If the user suggests a letter that occurs in the word, the program fills in the blanks with that letter in the right places. If the word does not contain the suggested letter, the program draws one element of a hangmanâ€™s gallows. As the game progresses, a segment of the gallows and of a victim is added for every suggested letter not in the word.

* Objective
Guess the word before your man gets hung!
